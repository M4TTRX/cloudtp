    "As you are all aware, Big Data and Cloud Computing are two distinct ideas, but the two\n",
    "concepts are often crossed intricately together. Big Data refers to gigantic amounts of data\n",
    "that can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually collected from different\n",
    "sources (eg., user input, sensors, sales data ..) for analytical purposes. The two main purposes\n",
    "of collecting this data is to i) find relevant patterns that can be exploited later (eg., to build\n",
    "statistical models) and ii) to process it in order to address some query. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge today\n",
    "(if you accept it :) ) is to dive deep into the data story-telling of one of two datasets that you\n",
    "can download and choose from moodle."
